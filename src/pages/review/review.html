      I will admit, I was a little concerned when Steven Wilson said that this was a more "pop-oriented" album than his previous efforts. However, I wasn't overly deterred, although "Permanating" did take some getting used to. And the other singles that came out before the album ("Pariah", "The Same Asylum as Before", "Song of I", and "Refuge") were all fine (in fact, I found them very compelling). So I figured that even if the rest of the album was poppy, it would still be a solid investment. And seeing the track lengths for other songs made me worry even less.

      This album sings truth … and it does so in a way that moves in streams far beyond those familiar to the committed fan of prog (or the collective fan of all things Wilson for that matter). To The Bone may end up being one of the most polarizing releases of Wilson’s career, but it could just as well represent one of the most impactful (culturally), transparent (lyrically) and accessible (musically) works of his storied career. Not having listened to any of the “pre-release” tracks, I trusted in the “virgin” listening experience to bring me to a definitive opinion about this work. If you listened to all the hype (about this being a “pop” divergence) you might have even gone to the extreme of declining a listen altogether. Don’t succumb to the hype – fans can be reassured that this is NOT a pop album whatsoever. Even the much maligned “Permanating” (nice word by the way), which does indeed hit the ears in a manner similar to Yes’s “Owner of a Lonely Heart” in that it is so strikingly catchy and danceable, is certainly never going to find its way into any “pop” jukebox rotation (okay maybe in the 70’s/80’s). Undeniably, however, Wilson has stepped outside of his comfort zone here and delivered something different from the introspective, dark and experimental world of Insurgentes/Grace For Drowning, the instrumentally indulgent, storybook world of Raven Refused to Sing, or even from the somewhat escapist world of the conceptually brilliant Hand.Cannot.Erase. In the end, though, would we expect anything less from one of the most innovative/talented artists of the past 20 years?

      I am a total SW fanboy, and I pretty much like everything he does, except when he goes too deep into the dissonant "noise".

      However, while I agree that this is a departure from his recent albums, this is what commercial prog rock should be; accessible rock rhythms and great melodies for those just wanting to hear a good song, but the lyrics go much deeper for those who want to feel the full impact of what this true artist is trying to convey. Good comparison would be "The Wall".
